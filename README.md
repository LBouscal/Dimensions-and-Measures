# ðŸ“Š Dimensions and Measures Visualization

## ðŸ“ˆ Overview
This Tableau project demonstrates the difference between **dimensions** and **measures** within a dataset. It highlights how Tableau categorizes fields (dimensions) and performs aggregations (measures) to create meaningful visualizations.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Tableauâ€™s data structure, essential for building dynamic and accurate dashboards.
