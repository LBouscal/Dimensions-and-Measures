# 📊 Dimensions and Measures Visualization

## 📈 Overview
This Tableau project demonstrates the difference between **dimensions** and **measures** within a dataset. It highlights how Tableau categorizes fields (dimensions) and performs aggregations (measures) to create meaningful visualizations.

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Tableau’s data structure, essential for building dynamic and accurate dashboards.
